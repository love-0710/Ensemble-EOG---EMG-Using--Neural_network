# Ensemble-EOG---EMG-Using--Neural_network
This project focuses on the ensemble analysis of Electrooculography (EOG) and Electromyography (EMG) signals, utilizing t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and neural networks for classification. The objective is to enhance the performance of classification models by leveraging the combined information from both EOG and EMG modalities.
